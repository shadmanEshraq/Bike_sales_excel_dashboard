## 📝 The Story Behind / Problem Statement  <a name = "a_0_TSB"></a>

<p align="justified"> 
We have some survey data on one thousand people from different backgrounds across continents. Analyzing the data, can we find some patterns for people who use bicycles? 
</p>

## 📊 Dashboard Summary  <a name = "a_1_DS"></a>

<p align="justified"> 
From our initial analysis, we tried to find any possible relationship considering the following three factors.

- What is the income level of the bike buyers across gender? 
- On which age group most of the buyers are?
- Is there any correlation between buying a bike and the commute distance of a customer?
